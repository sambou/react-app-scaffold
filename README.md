## React App Scaffold
My current scaffold for (Java|Type)Script apps with React & Redux.

## Setup
- ```git clone https://github.com/sambou/react-app-scaffold```
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` for dev server at localhost:3000
- ```npm test``` for unit tests
- ```npm run build``` gets run automatically in production environments via postinstall hook

## TODOs
- [ ] Add immutable data structures
- [ ] Configure webpack-dev-server
- [ ] Setup Redux debugger
